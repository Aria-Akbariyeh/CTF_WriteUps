# Methodology
1. Scan ports
2. port 80 was open. 
3. Browsed port 80 and found /development folder with some info 
4. enumerated SMB using enum4linux and found jay user 
5. Used Hydra to find password of jay on port22 SSH
6. copied linpeas.sh to the servre using scp
7. linpeas found a private key for the user kay
8. downloaded the private key and gave it chmod 600 (read only by the user, that's how ssh likes to be used)
9. the ssh key is passphrase protected. 
10. use john to crack it
	- First create a ssh2john file that formats ssh into a format that john can understand
		- /usr/share/john/ssh2john.py id_rsa > id_rsa_4john.txt

	- use john and rockyou to crack it
		john id_rsa_4john.txt --wordlist=~/wordlists/rockyou.txt

11. The passphrase provided by John: beeswax
12. found pass.bak file in kay folder: heresareallystrongpasswordthatfollowsthepasswordpolicy$$
